# PCA (Porsche Club of America) Car Control Skills

Car Control Skills events are about safe fun learning. You improve your driving skills 
by driving your car on several exercises at street (not racetrack) speeds while being
guided by instructors. The skills you learn are useful for safe and confident everyday
street driving, Driving Tours, preparing for your first track day ([High Performance Driver Education HPDE](https://www.pca.org/drivers-education)), trying 
out a car that is new to you, honing skills for [autocross](https://www.pca.org/autocross) and/or [HPDE](https://www.pca.org/drivers-education), or, just having 
fun driving your car how it should be driven. These events aim to leave you a safer more 
skilled driver whether you are a teen with still wet ink on your license, an extremely experienced 
track racer, or anything in between.

Each event is different, with event organizers selecting which skills are focused on and 
which exercises are used.

Exercises *might* include 

-   **Skid Pad** where you can explore how your vehicle behaves when losing traction, and 
learn the correct responses needed to recover from a skid. Useful as you don't want the first time you 
are dealing with a skid to be when it really matters. Better to have played and explored 
and built some instinct skid pad. Learn all about under steer and over steer. A great exercise for 
learning and refining weight transfer. Learn what lift off oversteer is and how to 
avoid it. [video of one in action.](https://youtu.be/OCbZgIk3hZM?t=4408)

- **Emergency and other Braking Exercises** where you learn how to use the most powerful system on
your vehicle. Exercises often start with straight line emergency braking and add elements to explore
balancing braking with turning or avoiding obstacles. Practice keeping your vision and awareness broad,
avoiding tunnel vision and target fixation, as well and managing traction with weight transfer. 

- **Slalom** where you weave between cones keeping your vision and plan far ahead of where you are and
learn to smoothly transition weight and grip from side to side, making a smooth arc around each cone.

- **Figure 8 or Oval** where you get to work the anatomy of a corner, placing the car for best visibility 
and control. Work on all phases of a corner; braking, turn in, turning, unwinding and exiting. Vision,
weight transfer, managing traction budget, and much more can be worked on.

- and others.

Here we provide a set of [Minimum Standards](./PCADriverSkillsMinimumStandards.md "PCA Car Control Skills event minimum standards") 
and many other materials needed to help a region design, organize, and host Car Control Skills events. 
Regions can also contact the PCA Car Control Skills team for advice on the smooth running of an event.
