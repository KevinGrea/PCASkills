# PCA Car Control Skills Minimum Standards

TODO: finalize nomenclature. Is the PCA National term:
- Driver Skills
- Car Control Skills (I'm leaning toward this)
- Car Control Clinic


## Purpose

The PCA (Porsche Club of America) Car Control Skills Minimum Standards are a common set of safety-based rules
upon which to build and improve regional Car Control Skills programs. These are also known as Car Control Clinics
or just Driver Skills. These standards are intended to minimize risk to the Club, Regions, 
and participants (drivers and non-drivers) and do not include many of the strictly administrative items 
necessary to put on a Car Control Skills event.
**Based on proven and safe practices, these Minimum Standards are 
designed to be basic in nature so any Region or Zone can have more stringent rules, but none more 
lenient.**

## Compliance

Any Region/Zone that plans to run a Car Control Skills event must meet all the minimum standards. Failure to 
comply could prevent issuance of PCA insurance for future Car Control Skills events. 

## Car Control Skills

**Definition:** A Car Control Skills event is an all forward gear non-competitive driving school in which one vehicle at a time drives 
exercise courses for one or more laps on a clearly defined closed course on a hard surface.
The Exercises are run in lower gears (typically 2nd) with an emphasis on handling and agility or other driving skills, 
rather than speed and power. There is no wheel-to-wheel racing, time trials or a gymkhana. More 
than one vehicle can be on an exercise course at the same time as long as vehicles do not run in proximity to each 
other and workers are not put at risk. There is no official timing or comparison of times. **This not a comitative event.**

**Autocross as an exercise:** An autocross course as an exercise, often as a "put it all together" exercise, is permissible as long as all 
minimum standards described herein are followed.

**Example exercises:** Exercises may include slalom, skid pads or rings, emergency braking, balancing braking and turning, 
emergency avoidance of objects combined with braking, figure 8, oval, or an autocross course. This list is not exhaustive.

**Exercise course:** An exercise course is a single exercise, or series of Exercises to be driven sequentially, with a defined start and finish.
Depending on design of the event, on completion of an exercise course cars may return to the grid for that exercise course,
or proceed to an different exercise course grid. exercise courses define the hot areas of an event. It is common for
exercise course to be setup and torn down throughout an event, although they also
may remain in place for the whole event.

**Joint Events: Multiple PCA Regions can host a Car Control Skills event; however,** one Region must be designated 
the host and is to take the lead role. It is the hosting Region’s responsibility to oversee the event, obtain 
PCA liability insurance, and submit the Observer, Post Event, and Incident Reports (if necessary).

Joint events with non-PCA organizations are prohibited.

## Roles/Responsibilities 

**Event Chair** – Manages the event from beginning to end. Submits the Post-Event Report within five (5) 
days to PCA.

**Safety Chair** – Reviews and approves the course design, including grid/staging areas, with an objective 
eye towards safety issues. Cannot be the Event Chair, exercise course, or curriculum designer.

As the event proceeds, the Safety Chair watches for unsafe situations and takes corrective action as 
needed. Any issues shall be discussed by the Event Chair, exercise course designer(s) and Safety Chair. **The 
Safety Chair is the final arbiter for decisions related to safety.**

**Event Observer** – Impartial member (not involved in the management of the event) who attends the 
event and submits the PCA Observer’s Report for Car Control Skills within ten (10) days after the event. 

**Driving Instructors** – Designated by the Event Chair, prior to the beginning of exercise course runs. Qualifications 
are at the Region’s discretion.

**Candidate Driving Instructors** – Designated by the Event Chair, prior to the beginning of exercise 
course runs, along with mentoring Instructors.
Qualifications are at the Region’s discretion.


## Administration

**Insurance:** The liability insurance certificate issued by PCA showing the insurance coverage, date of the 
event and venue shall be kept on site during the event. Any entities required to be named on the insurance 
certificate by the site owner must be included. 

**Waiver:** Everyone at the event location must sign the appropriate PCA insurance waiver as designated in 
the then current Region Procedures Manual (RPM) and follow other procedures as designated in the Insurance 
Section of the RPM.

TODO: Excluding minors. Given the nature of these events is for improving street driving (as well as prepping for and honing skills for AX and DE), should we
be excluding minor drivers? THe JPP is very narrow and my experience has been that many early drivers really benefit from exploring
and growing skills. See the "Who Attends PCA PNWR Driver Skills" document for an example of having a few teens at each event works in practice.
PCA PNWR is so happy to train the minors we share the road with, we offer them a discounted rate for events.
Option: Require a guardian on site, full waiver, but allow learners permits and minors at discretion of the Event Chair.

**Junior Participant Program (JPP)**  
The JPP excludes minors except for fully licensed sons, daughters, nephews, nieces, step-children or grandchildren of 
PCA members from participating in PCA events such as Driver Skills. The parent or legal guardian of the JPP entrant does not have 
to be a PCA member if the uncle, aunt, grandparent or step-parent is a PCA member, and this member is 
in attendance at the event, along with the JPP entrant.  All requirements for JPP as set forth in the then 
current version of the RPM (Region Procedures Manual) must be followed. 

**Facility Contractual Requirements:** The event organizers must adhere to any facility-specific safety 
requirements that are more stringent than the PCA Minimum Standards; e.g., on-site medical, sound 
limits, etc. 

**Drivers/Safety Meeting:** All events must have a drivers meeting to review event procedures, safety, site 
risks, restricted areas and policies before the start of event. *All participants must 
attend.* Site boundary safety shall be discussed and site boundary protocol shall be established to 
ensure site boundaries are clearly defined and maintained. 

**Incident Report:** For any incident or other contact resulting in physical damage to an automobile and/or 
the facility, an incident report is required to be submitted to the individuals indicated on the current 
Incident Report Form within five (5) business days. The electronic Incident Report Form is available on 
the PCA web site and is part of the insurance packet received from the National Office when you 
submitted an insurance enrollment form. 

For bodily injury to any individual at the event that requires medical attention, an incident report must be 
written and submitted to our National Insurance Chairman and National Safety Chair by the next business 
day. 

Verbal altercations or personal injury of any person on site requires an Incident report. 

**PCA Observer’s Report:** The PCA Observer’s Report must be completed within 10 days by an impartial 
party (i.e., not the Event Chair or other event management) who attended the event. Go to pca.org for the 
form. 

**Post Event Report:** The Post Event Report must be submitted within 5 days (located on pca.org under 
Event Management). 

For further information on insurance, the Junior Participation Program, Reports, etc., please refer to the 
Region Procedure Manual (RPM). 

## Site

**Facility:** An Car Control Skills event must be held on a paved surface (i.e., asphalt, concrete, etc.). Use of a non
paved surface, except for parking, paddock, etc. requires approval from the National Safety Chair. 

**Entrance Control:** Special care shall be taken to monitor site boundaries to ensure non-participants do 
not wander through or enter the site at non-designated entry points. 

**Off Limits Areas:** The site owner, Event Chair or Safety Chair may designate areas of the event site as 
off limits and care must be taken to follow these requirements. 

**Restricted Areas:** The exercise courses and the areas near the them are considered restricted 
areas and access to these areas is restricted to adults only (18 years of age or older). The only exception is 
for 16 & 17-year-old Junior Participation Program (JPP) entrants when they are driving the Exercises. 
Additionally, areas near the exercise that off-course or out of control cars might enter are also restricted 
areas. The Event Chair and Safety Chair are empowered to designate, as necessary, other areas as restricted, 
and to further restrict parts of restricted areas, such as limiting the exercise course, start and finish to workers only. 
Restricted areas shall be limited to participating vehicles, drivers, workers, instructors and 
photographers as approved by the Event Chair. Photographers in restricted areas must be accompanied by 
a spotter whose only responsibility is to spot for the photographer. General event viewing is not allowed 
in restricted areas. JPP entrants cannot have a work assignment in a restricted area.

**Unrestricted Areas:** Other areas such as viewing areas and paddock are considered unrestricted areas 
and are accessible to all participants after signing the waiver. 

**Refueling:** No smoking within 20 feet of refueling activities. Vehicles shall have their engines turned off 
while refueling. A fully-charged fire extinguisher nearby is required. 

**Fire Safety:** A fully-charged fire extinguisher on each exercise course start point is required.

**Drones:** The use of drones is not permitted within the event boundary as per PCA National Policy. 

## Entrants

**Entrants:** A registered entrant is defined as a person who will be participating in substantially all 
appropriate aspects of the event (driver’s meeting, corner working, etc.). This does not mean, however, a 
registered entrant must attend the event full time, or participate in exercises that are not 
scheduled for such entrant. Registering people for the sole purpose of fun rides is not permitted. 

TODO: allow learner's permits? Minors exclusion again.

**Driver’s License:** All entrants must have a valid driver's license, verified either during on-line 
registration or when the driver checks in.

**Entrant Age:** The minimum age for any driving entrant is 18 years, except for JPP entrants. 

**Helmets** Helmets are not required. A region may decide to require helmets for the event. This requirement is
decided before the event day and cannot be changed during the event. If an event 
requires helmets, the standards regarding helmets defined in the Autocross Minimum standards apply. 

**Clothing (Shoes, etc.):** 
Footwear must be non-slip and NOT be open-toe or have heavy-duty soles such as 
those found on hiking shoes or work boots. 

**Eye Protection:** If the car does not have a windshield, the occupants must wear eye protection 
specifically meant to protect eyes from flying objects (shatterproof eye protection). 

**Car Occupancy:** When a vehicle is on course while the course is hot, all the following apply.
Only registered entrants are allowed in vehicles. No more than two people can be in the car at one time except for cases covered
under Instructor Candidates. If two people are in a car, one must be a designated Driver Skills instructor. The driver must have
sole control of the car – no blindfolded driving or any physical control input by a passenger. Drivers and passengers must be
belted in the car. If helmets are required for the event, they must have helmets on and chin straps fastened while on course. 

**Instructor Candidates:** A registered entrant may be designated as an instructor candidate by event Chair.
Instructor candidates are being trained, evaluated and trialed toward the goal of being designated as an instructor by the 
Event Chair for future events. An instructor candidate my be a third, non-driving, occupant in a vehicle (either observing 
instruction or being observed giving instruction). They can also act as an instructor with approval from Event Chair as part 
of their training.

**No alcohol or controlled substances can be consumed by any person 
at the site of the event during the hours of event operation.** This is not 
intended to prevent participants from taking medication prescribed by a physician as long as it does not 
have an unreasonable effect on a person’s ability to control a vehicle at speed. 

## Vehicle

**Eligible Vehicles:** All Porsche vehicles and other manufacturer automobiles are eligible. Karts and 
motorcycles are not allowed to participate; karts must not be operated within the boundary of the event as 
per PCA National Policy. 

**Vehicle Safety Inspection:** It is the sole responsibility of each entrant to present a vehicle that is safe 
to operate in Exercises at the event and is in sound mechanical condition. Safety inspection by PCA Region 
volunteers does not relieve a entrant of their responsibility for the safety of the vehicle they entered.  
All vehicles must be inspected by designated safety inspectors on the day of the event before being 
allowed on course. This inspection shall confirm: helmet (if required) 
meets the rating requirements, restraint system is operational, all loose objects are removed, cameras are 
properly attached, the brake pedal is firm, the throttle operates properly, seats are properly attached and 
functional, wheels are properly secured, there are no significant fluid leaks, tire and wheel integrity is 
checked, the 12v battery is secure (if accessible), and the fuel cap is present and secure, and any other items deemed 
necessary by safety inspection. A vehicle that has passed vehicle safety inspection must be identified with 
a label or some other marking, so it is easily identifiable as having passed the safety inspection. 

**Re-inspection:** If a car leaves the course surface or hits an obstruction, it must be re-inspected. 

**Testing:** Cars are not allowed to be running while any part of the car is off the ground (on a jack or jack 
stands). 

**Roll Bars:** Roll bars are required in Modified cars (as defined in the PCA Parade Competition Rules) that 
do not have open-car factory rollover protection. For non-Porsche vehicles, acceptance of the car will be at the 
discretion of the Event Chair and the Safety Chair.  

**Seat Belts:** All vehicles must have either factory seat belts and/or multi-point harnesses and be in use by 
all occupants. If the participant chooses to install a five- or six-point harness, several changes to the 
automobile may need to be made to create a safe occupant restraint system. Must be installed per the 
manufacturer’s instructions. All belts must be in good condition and not overly worn, frayed, or stiff. 

TODO: multi-point belts with no HANS? Should this be explicitly disallowed? Even at "low speed" a harness puts neck at risk.

**Hybrid / Electric Vehicles** Regions shall verify if the Event Facility permits Hybrid / Electric Vehicles on track.
Regions may decide if they shall allow all car marques, just Porsche-brand or no Hybrid / Electric Vehicles to participate
in Event. 

**High Pressure Gas Cylinders:** High pressure gas and air bottles (over 400 psi tanks) must have 
protection for the regulator. Oxygen bottles required for medical reasons by an entrant while they are 
driving are allowed but must be properly attached to the vehicle. 

## Course Design and Event Layout

**Safety:** Safety of everyone is the most important consideration in the design of the exercise courses. 
During the design process a “what if” exercise is required to assess and address potential accident 
scenarios. 

**Course:** Soft, moveable items will be used to define the course. No fixed objects shall be used to define 
the course. Special care shall be taken to ensure the course is designed with safety in mind such that if a 
vehicle leaves the course, there is enough safe runoff area and participants or property are not at risk. 

**Obstructions:** The course shall not normally pass closer than 25 feet from obstructions (solid objects, 
light poles, curbs, fences, ditches, etc.) and extreme care must be taken if the course is closer than this. On 
sections of the course where speeds are higher, additional margin from fixed obstructions is required. 
Particular attention shall be placed in the area past the end of exercise which shall be kept clear of parked cars 
and people at all times. The use of a “stop-box” at the end of an exercise course does not remove this requirement. 

**Start/Finish/Grid:** Extreme care shall be taken in the location of the start, finish, grid areas.
The grid areas must be placed well clear of the course in a safe area. 
The end of each exercise course area shall be clearly and carefully defined to safely restrict speeds. 

**Surface:** The exercise courses shall be on a paved or concrete surface and will be well clear of dangerous 
holes, loose gravel, gratings, oily spots, or hazardous features other than incidental asphalt sloughing due 
to weather and wear. 

**Speeds:** The exercise courses must be designed such that maximum speeds shall be in the mid-60 mph /100 kph for 
stock, later-model normal production cars with around 300 hp on street tires (993, 996, 997, 981, etc. not 
GT3, Turbo, etc.). The fastest portions of the course shall be the most remote from participants and 
obstructions.

**Multiple Cars:** Extreme care and special design consideration shall be taken with exercise courses where multiple 
cars are on the course simultaneously to ensure cars cannot cross paths, even in the event both drivers 
leave the intended driving path. 

## Course Workers

**Staffing:** The exercise courses must have a starter (stages cars, conducts final safety check - helmets, 
belts, closed doors and hoods, checks course is ready, launches car). Optionally there may be course reset stations staffed by 
one or more workers to cover the course. 
Station Location: Course rest stations must be placed at a safe distance from any vehicle’s path on course. 
Special care shall be taken to ensure potential off course driving does not endanger course workers. 

**Training:** A Worker’s Meeting (may be part of the Driver’s Meeting) must be conducted to ensure all 
workers are safe and that they understand their roles and responsibilities.

A discussion regarding the proper use of safety equipment (fire extinguishers, flags and radios), worker 
safety, course worker expectations, and all that workers are expected to do in the event of an emergency 
shall be covered. Course workers shall be given clear instructions to ensure their safety (e.g., safety first - 
get off the course well before a car arrives, even if the course is not reset). 

**Equipment:** Each exercise course must have an unfurled flag which can be used to stop cars on course when 
required, and effective communication (radio, voice, hand signals, flags, air horn). Each exercise
course must have one up-to-date and fully-charged fire extinguisher. 

**Worker Attention:** While cars are running an exercise course at speed, all course workers must be standing.
The course starter, with the flag, keeps an eye on the safety situation 
and lets other workers reset cones. All course workers must not be using any other devices (cameras, 
video cameras, cell phones, etc.) that can distract their attention away from moving vehicles.
