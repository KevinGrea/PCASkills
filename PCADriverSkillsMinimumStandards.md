# PCA Autocross Minimum Standards

## Purpose

The PCA (Porsche Club of America) Autocross Minimum Standards are a common set of safety-based rules upon which to build and 
improve regional autocross programs. These standards are intended to minimize risk to the Club, Regions, 
and participants (drivers and non-drivers) and do not include many of the strictly administrative items 
necessary to put on an autocross.
**Based on proven and safe practices, these Minimum Standards are 
designed to be basic in nature so any Region or Zone can have more stringent rules, but none more 
lenient.**

## Compliance

Any Region/Zone that plans to run an autocross event must meet all the minimum standards. Failure to 
comply could prevent issuance of PCA insurance for future autocross events. 

## Autocross

**Definition:** An autocross is an all forward gear competitive driving event in which one vehicle at a time is 
timed for one or more laps on a clearly defined closed course on a hard surface with a defined start and 
finish line. An autocross is run in lower gears (typically 2nd) with an emphasis on handling and agility 
rather than speed and power. An autocross is not wheel-to-wheel racing, a time trial or a gymkhana. More 
than one vehicle can be on the course at the same time as long as vehicles do not run in proximity to each 
other and workers are not put at risk. There can be official timing of each lap with appropriate penalties 
for course deviations and awards can be given for finishing positions in class and/or overall. 

**Practice Runs:** Practice runs are permissible as long as all minimum standards described herein are 
followed. 

**Test and Tune Days:** Holding “Test and Tune” (open practice) events are permissible as long as all 
minimum standards described herein are followed. 

**Joint Events: Multiple PCA Regions can host an autocross; however,** one Region must be designated 
the host and is to take the lead role. It is the hosting Region’s responsibility to oversee the event, obtain 
PCA liability insurance, and submit the Observer, Post Event, and Incident Reports (if necessary). 

Joint events with non-PCA organizations are prohibited. 

## Roles/Responsibilities 

**Event Chair** – Manages the event from beginning to end. Submits the Post-Event Report within five (5) 
days to PCA. 

**Safety Chair** – Reviews and approves the course design, including grid/staging areas, with an objective 
eye towards safety issues. Cannot be the Event Chair or course designer.

As the event proceeds, the Safety Chair watches for unsafe situations and takes corrective action as 
needed. Any issues shall be discussed by the Event Chair, course designer(s) and Safety Chair. **The 
Safety Chair is the final arbiter for decisions related to safety.**

**Event Observer** – Impartial member (not involved in the management of the event) who attends the 
event and submits the PCA Observer’s Report for Autocross within ten (10) days after the event. 

**Driving Instructors** – Designated by the Event Chair, prior to the beginning of timed runs. Qualifications 
are at the Region’s discretion. 

## Administration

**Insurance:** The liability insurance certificate issued by PCA showing the insurance coverage, date of the 
event and venue shall be kept on site during the event. Any entities required to be named on the insurance 
certificate by the site owner must be included. 

**Waiver:** Everyone at the event location must sign the appropriate PCA insurance waiver as designated in 
the then current Region Procedures Manual (RPM) and follow other procedures as designated in the Insurance 
Section of the RPM 

**Junior Participant Program (JPP)**  
The JPP allows the fully licensed sons, daughters, nephews, nieces, step-children or grandchildren of 
PCA members to participate in autocrosses. The parent or legal guardian of the JPP entrant does not have 
to be a PCA member if the uncle, aunt, grandparent or step-parent is a PCA member, and this member is 
in attendance at the event, along with the JPP entrant.  All requirements for JPP as set forth in the then 
current version of the RPM must be followed. 

**Facility Contractual Requirements:** The event organizers must adhere to any facility-specific safety 
requirements that are more stringent than the PCA Minimum Standards; e.g., on-site medical, sound 
limits, etc. 

**Drivers/Safety Meeting:** All events must have a drivers meeting to review event procedures, safety, site 
risks, restricted areas and policies before the start of competition. *All participants must 
attend.* Site boundary safety shall be discussed and site boundary protocol shall be established to 
ensure site boundaries are clearly defined and maintained. 

**Incident Report:** For any incident or other contact resulting in physical damage to an automobile and/or 
the facility, an incident report is required to be submitted to the individuals indicated on the current 
Incident Report Form within five (5) business days. The electronic Incident Report Form is available on 
the PCA web site and is part of the insurance packet received from the National Office when you 
submitted an insurance enrollment form. 

For bodily injury to any individual at the event that requires medical attention, an incident report must be 
written and submitted to our National Insurance Chairman and National Safety Chair by the next business 
day. 

Verbal altercations or personal injury of any person on site requires an Incident report. 

**PCA Observer’s Report:** The PCA Observer’s Report must be completed within 10 days by an impartial 
party (i.e., not the Event Chair or other event management) who attended the event. Go to pca.org for the 
form. 

**Post Event Report:** The Post Event Report must be submitted within 5 days (located on pca.org under 
Event Management). 

For further information on insurance, the Junior Participation Program, Reports, etc., please refer to the 
Region Procedure Manual. 

## Site

**Facility:** An autocross event must be held on a paved surface (i.e., asphalt, concrete, etc.). Use of a non
paved surface, except for parking, paddock, etc. requires approval from the National Safety Chair. 

**Entrance Control:** Special care shall be taken to monitor site boundaries to ensure non-participants do 
not wander through or enter the site at undesignated entry points. 

**Off Limits Areas:** The site owner, Event Chair or Safety Chair may designate areas of the event site as 
off limits and care must be taken to follow these requirements. 

**Restricted Areas:** The autocross course and the areas near the start and finish are considered restricted 
areas and access to these areas is restricted to adults only (18 years of age or older). The only exception is 
for 16 & 17-year-old Junior Participation Program (JPP) entrants when they are taking their runs. 
Additionally, areas near the course that off-course or out of control cars might enter are also restricted 
areas. The Event Chair and Safety Chair are empowered to designate as necessary other areas as restricted 
and to further restrict parts of restricted areas such as limiting the course, start and finish to workers only. 
Restricted areas shall be limited to competing vehicles, competitors, workers, instructors and 
photographers as approved by the Event Chair. Photographers in restricted areas must be accompanied by 
a spotter whose only responsibility is to spot for the photographer. General event viewing is not allowed 
in restricted areas. JPP entrants cannot have a work assignment in a restricted area. 

**Unrestricted Areas:** Other areas such as viewing areas and paddock are considered unrestricted areas 
and are accessible to all participants after signing the waiver. 

**Refueling:** No smoking within 20 feet of refueling activities. Vehicles shall have their engines turned off 
while refueling. A fully-charged fire extinguisher nearby is required. 

**Grid Fire Safety:** A fully-charged fire extinguisher on grid is required. 

**Drones:** The use of drones is not permitted within the event boundary as per PCA National Policy. 

## Entrants

**Entrants:** A registered entrant is defined as a person who will be participating in substantially all 
appropriate aspects of the event (driver’s meeting, corner working, etc.). This does not mean, however, a 
registered entrant must attend the event full time, or participate in sessions or exercises that are not 
scheduled for such entrant. Registering people for the sole purpose of fun rides is not permitted, though a 
3 
“Taste of Autocross” program is allowed if the participant rides with a designated instructor and meets all 
the requirements of an entrant (waiver, registration, fee must be paid). 

**Driver’s License:** All entrants must have a valid driver's license, verified either during on-line 
registration or when the driver checks in.

**Entrant Age:** The minimum age for any driving entrant is 18 years, except for JPP entrants. 

**Clothing (Helmet, Shoes, etc.):** All vehicle occupants while on course must wear an approved helmet. 
Helmets built to Snell Foundation standards or other standards such as FIA 8860, SFI 31.1 and BS6658
85 Type A-FR are approved for use. Approved helmets must be manufactured to the current rating or the 
two most recent SA, M or K Snell ratings. For example, if the current Snell SA standard is SA2015, 
helmets meeting SA2015, SA2010 and SA2005 are allowed. Also, any helmet approved for PCA Club 
Racing is permitted. Footwear must be non-slip and NOT be open-toe or have heavy-duty soles such as 
those found on hiking shoes or work boots. 

**Eye Protection:** If the car does not have a windshield, the occupants must wear eye protection 
specifically meant to protect eyes from flying objects (shatterproof eye protection). 

**Car Occupancy:** Only registered entrants are allowed in vehicles on course while the course is hot and 
no more than two people can be in the car at one time. If two people are in a car, one must be a designated 
autocross instructor. The driver must have sole control of the car – no blindfolded driving or any physical 
control input by a passenger. Drivers and passengers must be belted in the car with helmets on and chin 
straps fastened while on course. 

**No alcohol or controlled substances can be consumed by any person 
at the site of the event during the hours of event operation.** This is not 
intended to prevent participants from taking medication prescribed by a physician as long as it does not 
have an unreasonable effect on a person’s ability to control a vehicle at speed. 

## Vehicle

**Eligible Vehicles:** All Porsche vehicles and other manufacturer automobiles are eligible. Karts and 
motorcycles are not allowed to participate; karts must not be operated within the boundary of the event as 
per PCA National Policy. 

**Vehicle Safety Inspection:** It is the sole responsibility of each competitor to present a vehicle that is safe 
to operate in a competition event and is in sound mechanical condition. Safety inspection by PCA Region 
volunteers does not relieve a competitor of their responsibility for the safety of the vehicle they entered.  
All vehicles must be inspected by designated safety inspectors on the day of the event before being 
allowed on course. “Annual” safety inspection is not a substitute. This inspection shall confirm: helmet 
meets the rating requirements, restraint system is operational, all loose objects are removed, cameras are 
properly attached, the brake pedal is firm, the throttle operates properly, seats are properly attached and 
functional, wheels are properly secured, there are no significant fluid leaks, tire and wheel integrity is 
checked, the battery is secure, and the fuel cap is present and secure, and any other items deemed 
necessary by safety inspection. A vehicle that has passed vehicle safety inspection must be identified with 
a label or some other marking, so it is easily identifiable as having passed the safety inspection. 

**Re-inspection:** If a car leaves the course surface or hits an obstruction, it must be re-inspected. 

**Testing:** Cars are not allowed to be running while any part of the car is off the ground (on a jack or jack 
stands). 

**Roll Bars:** Roll bars are required in Modified cars (as defined in the PCA Parade Competition Rules) that 
do not have open-car factory rollover protection. For non-Porsches, acceptance of the car will be at the 
discretion of the Event Chair and the Safety Chair.  

**Seat Belts:** All vehicles must have either factory seat belts and/or multi-point harnesses and be in use by 
all occupants. If the participant chooses to install a five- or six-point harness, several changes to the 
automobile may need to be made to create a safe occupant restraint system. Must be installed per the 
manufacturer’s instructions.  All belts must be in good condition and not overly worn, frayed, or stiff. 

**High Pressure Gas Cylinders:** High pressure gas and air bottles (over 400 psi tanks) must have 
protection for the regulator. Oxygen bottles required for medical reasons by an entrant while they are 
driving are allowed but must be properly attached to the vehicle. 

## Course Design and Event Layout

**Safety:** Safety of everyone is the most important consideration in the design of the autocross course. 
During the design process a “what if” exercise is required to assess and address potential accident 
scenarios. 

**Course:** Soft, moveable items will be used to define the course. No fixed objects shall be used to define 
the course. Special care shall be taken to ensure the course is designed with safety in mind such that if a 
vehicle leaves the course, there is enough safe runoff area and participants or property are not at risk. 

**Obstructions:** The course shall not normally pass closer than 25 feet from obstructions (solid objects, 
light poles, curbs, fences, ditches, etc.) and extreme care must be taken if the course is closer than this. On 
sections of the course where speeds are higher, additional margin from fixed obstructions is required. 
Particular attention shall be placed in the area past the finish line which shall be kept clear of parked cars 
and people at all times. The use of a “stop-box” after the finish does not remove this requirement. 

**Start/Finish/Grid/Staging/Timing:** Extreme care shall be taken in the location of the start, finish, grid, 
staging and timing areas. The timing and grid areas must be placed well clear of the course in a safe area. 
The finish area shall be clearly and carefully defined to safely restrict speeds. 

**Surface:** The course layout shall be on a paved or concrete surface and will be well clear of dangerous 
holes, loose gravel, gratings, oily spots, or hazardous features other than incidental asphalt sloughing due 
to weather and wear. 

**Speeds:** The course must be designed such that maximum speeds shall be in the mid-60 mph /100 kph for 
stock, later-model normal production cars with around 300 hp on street tires (993, 996, 997, 981, etc. not 
GT3, Turbo, etc.). The fastest portions of the course shall be the most remote from participants and 
obstructions.

**Multiple Cars:** Extreme care and special design consideration shall be taken with courses where multiple 
cars are on the course simultaneously to ensure cars cannot cross paths, even in the event both drivers 
leave the intended driving path. 

## Course Workers

**Staffing:** The autocross course must have a starter (stages cars, conducts final safety check - helmets, 
belts, closed doors and hoods, checks course is ready, launches car) and sufficient flag stations staffed by 
one or more workers to cover the course. 
Station Location: Flag stations must be placed at a safe distance from any vehicle’s path on course. 
Special care shall be taken to ensure potential off course driving does not endanger course workers. 

**Training:** A Worker’s Meeting (may be part of the Driver’s Meeting) must be conducted to ensure all 
workers are safe and that they understand their roles and responsibilities.

A discussion regarding the proper use of safety equipment (fire extinguishers, flags and radios), worker 
safety, course worker expectations, and all that workers are expected to do in the event of an emergency 
shall be covered. Course workers shall be given clear instructions to ensure their safety (e.g., safety first - 
get off the course well before a car arrives, even if the course is not reset). 

**Equipment:** Each flag station must have an unfurled flag which can be used to stop cars on course when 
required, and effective communication (radio, voice, hand signals, flags, air horn). The grid and one 
centrally located flag station must each have one up-to-date and fully-charged fire extinguisher. 

**Safety:** While cars are running the course at speed, all course workers must be standing. In order to 
quickly control the course, when more than one worker is present at a work station, one worker must 
handle both the communication and the flag. The worker with the flag keeps an eye on the safety situation 
and lets other workers reset cones. All course workers must not be using any other devices (cameras, 
video cameras, cell phones, etc.) that can distract their attention away from moving vehicles.
