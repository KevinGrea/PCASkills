# PCA (Porsche Club of America) Car Control Skills materials

## Goals:

Create minimum standards and materials that are suitable for Porsche Club of America (PCA) regions running Car Control Clinics (CCC). The new standards and materials should not be a burden but instead helpful to regions that are currently running such an events under current Driver Education (DE) or autocross (AX) minimum standards, and very helpful to regions that wish to start running Car Control Clinics.

Enabling PCA event insurance for CCC events without cost to the region, just as PCA does today for autocross events.

No disruption to the existing regional programs that are already running. These existing programs should be able to move to the new standards, from the DE and AX standards they currently run under, with no (or minimal) changes. Regions have been running these events since before the turn of the century, this is just to formalize what is already happening and to help other regions run such events.

To create materials and advice that would assist regions in starting and running Car Control Clinic programs that provide their members with safe, fun, and educational events that improve their driving skills for the street, autocross, High Performance Driver Education (HPDE) track events, or anywhere they drive their cars. These materials that are not part of the mandated minimum standards could include; logistics, exercises (formats and teaching materials), site selection, space usage, feedback and program improvement methods, and any other lessons learnt from the existing long running programs.

## Explicit non-goals:

- We are not mandating a curriculum. Getting all to agree on "the best" exercises, teaching points, and effective skills areas of focus, would be difficult to say the least. Providing  materials from a number of successful curriculum exercises and areas of focus can be helpful, without having to mandate any given element. Regions will adapt to suit local motivations and site constraints.

- We are not making a teen only program set of standards. These standards are for general Car Control Clinics where adults of all skill levels can attend.

- We don't want to create overhead for any region that wishes to run a Car Control Clinic. No rules just to have rules or control. A region should feel that minimums reduce the work needed to host a program, not add to it.

- No new national requirements for drivers wishing to do a DE or AX event. Car Control Clinic programs may increase interest in DE and AX programs, but they are not a pre-requisite for those wanting to attend DE or AX events. A local region might choose to require a CCC attendance but it will not be a national minimum standard.
